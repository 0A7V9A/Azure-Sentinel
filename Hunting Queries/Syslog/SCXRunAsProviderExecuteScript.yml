name: SCX RunAsProvider ExecuteScript
description: |
  'This hunting query uses Auditd security events collected via the Syslog data connector to explore the use of the SCX RunAsProvider ExecuteScript to execute any UNIX/Linux script using the /bin/sh shell.
  Script being executed gets created a temp file in /tmp folder with a scx* prefix. Then it is invoked from the following directory /etc/opt/microsoft/scx/conf/tmpdir/. The file in that directory has the same prefix scx*.
  The file is deleted after execution from the /etc/opt/microsoft/scx/conf/tmpdir.
  SCXcore, started as the Microsoft Operations Manager UNIX/Linux Agent, is now used in a host of products including Microsoft Operations Manager. Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Operations Management Suite.
