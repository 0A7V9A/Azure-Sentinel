The PAN-OS Administrator’s Guide provides additional information about Syslog configuration. Please refer to the [latest PAN-OS Administrator’s Guide](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin) to ensure that you have configured log forwarding correctly for all the log types that you would like to forward to Sentinel platform.\n\nGo to [Palo Alto CEF Configuration]({0})  and Palo Alto [Configure Syslog Monitoring]({1})  steps 2, 3, choose your version, and follow the instructions using the following guidelines:\n\n1.  To configure the device to include its IP address in the header of Syslog messages, select **Panorama/Device > Setup > Management**, click the Edit icon in the **Logging and Reporting Settings** section and navigate to the **Log Export and Reporting** tab. In the Syslog HOSTNAME Format drop-down select **ipv4-address or ipv6-address**, then click **OK**.\n\n2.  Select **Device > Server Profiles > Syslog** and click **Add**.\n\n3.  Enter a server profile **Name** and **Location** (location refers to a virtual system, if the device is enabled for virtual systems).\n\n4.  In the **Servers** tab, click **Add** and enter a **Name**, IP address (**Syslog Server** field), **Transport**, **Port** (default 514 for UDP), and **Facility** (default LOG_USER) for the Syslog server.\n\n5.  Select the **Custom Log Format** tab and click any of the listed log types (Config, System, Threat, Traffic, URL, Data, WildFire, Tunnel, Authentication, User-ID, HIP Match) to define a custom format based on the CEF for that log type.\n\n6.  Modify the default CEF header format to make sure we always have 7 fields in CEF header as Sentinel log analytics agent can only parse fixed header (7 fields in header)\n\n a. For example, log types “Global Protect” have only 6 fields, and SCTP only have 5 fields in the default configuration. We can introduce dummy fields to make sure we have 7 fields\n\n7.
