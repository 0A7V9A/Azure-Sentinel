// Name: Suspect Application Consent
// Description: This will alert when the "Consent to application" operation occurs by an user that has not done this operation before or rarely does this.
// This could indicate that permissions to access the listed AzureApp was provided to a malicious actor. Consent to appliction, Add service principal and Add OAuth2PermissionGrant should be rare.
// If available, additional context is added from the AuditLogs based on CorrleationId from the same account that performed "Consent to application"
// Operations such as Add Service Principal, Add app role assignment grant user, Consent to Application, among others.
// To help understand AuditLogs please see - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-audit-activities
// This may help detect the Oauth2 attack that can be initiated by this publicly available tool - https://github.com/fireeye/PwnAuth
