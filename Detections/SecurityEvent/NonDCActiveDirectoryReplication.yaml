name: Non Domain Controller Active Directory Replication
description: |
  This query detects potential attempts to sync an active directory object leveraging directory replication services (DRS) from a non-domain-controller account.
  A Domain Controller (computer account) would be the one performing this actions in a domain environment.
  A domain user with privileged permissions to use directory replication services is rare. Ref: https://threathunterplaybook.com/notebooks/windows/06_credential_access/WIN-180815210510.html'
