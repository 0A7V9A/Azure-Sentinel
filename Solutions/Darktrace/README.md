# Microsoft Sentinel Solution for Darktrace

This repository contains the code for the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for Darktrace and reflects code committed into Microsoft's Github: https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Solutions/AI%20Analyst%20Darktrace

This is the Darktrace integration with Microsoft's SIEM product **Microsoft Sentinel**. It provides:

- Dashboard (Workbook) which a Sentinel user can utilize for a graphical view of Darktrace Model Breaches and AI Analyst incident
- Data Connector which allows Darktrace data to be sent to and parsed by Microsoft Sentinel

## Current state

Currently Microsoft is in the process of migrating all of the legacy integrations, including Darktrace, into the Sentinel Solutions Content Hub and [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-GB/marketplace).

You can read more about Sentinel Solutions in Microsoft's Documentaion portal - [Sentinel Solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions)

You can find the solutions build guide on [Sentinel Github](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Solutions#guide-to-building-microsoft-sentinel-solutions)

Additional work is currently ongoing to update and improve the integration, it is led by Sean MacDonald and overseen by Matt Bovbjerg and Adam Stevens.
