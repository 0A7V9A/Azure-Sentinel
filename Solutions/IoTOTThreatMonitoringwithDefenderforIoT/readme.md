# Overview
There has been a long-standing split between SCADA (OT) and Corporate (IT) cybersecurity. This split was often driven by significant differences in technology/tooling. Azure Defender for IoT's integration with Azure Sentinel drives convergency by providing a single pane for coverage of both D4IOT (OT) and Azure Sentinel (IT) alerting. 
This solution includes (1) Workbook and (10) Analytics rules and provides a guided investigation for security operations teams. The workbook features IT/OT filtering for Security Alerts, Incidents, and Asset Inventory. The workbook also features a dynamic assessment of the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS matrix across your environment to analyze and respond to IOT-based threats. This solution is designed to enable SecOps Analysts, Security Engineers, and MSSPs to gain situational awareness for IT/OT security posture. This solution is enhanced when integrated with complimentary Microsoft Offerings such as ✳️ Azure Defender for IoT, ✳️ Azure Sentinel, and ✳️ Azure Security Center. This workbook augments staffing through automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, query/alerting generation and visualizations.
