- **/azuresentinel** - Microsoft power platform connectors https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/azuresentinel/


# Deployment

> **Due to internal Microsoft Logic Apps dependencies, please deploy first the ImportToSentinel playbook before any of the IndicatorProcessor one.**

## ImportToSentinel

This playbooks will serve via the Microsoft Batching mechanism all of the IndicatorProcessor playbooks, for optimizition of the indicator deployment process.
