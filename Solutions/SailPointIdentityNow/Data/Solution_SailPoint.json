  "Description": "Digital transformation has opened up opportunities for greater agility and growth in today’s modern enterprises. But it’s also introducing challenges. Digital transformation has introduced an explosion of cloud, applications, data, and users to manage. Being able to effectively control ‘who can have access to what’ is the key and if not done properly can lead to potential risk to your business.\n\rTo address this potential risk, organizations are embracing the power and ease of SailPoint Identity Security. This innovative identity platform takes the complexity out of identity; making it intuitive for IT staff to configure and manage and enabling business users with the access they need to get their work done.\n\rThe [SailPoint](https://www.sailpoint.com/) IdentityNow custom connector enables Azure Sentinel customers to utilize the deep, enriched contextual data and governance capabilities of the SailPoint Identity Security to better drive identity-aware security practices.",
