## Overview
This playbook uses the DomainTools Iris Investigate API and Farsight DNSDB API. Given a domain or set of domains associated with an incident, enrich the domain using the DomainTools Iris Investigate API, returning whois and infrastructure details. Subsequently retrieve associated subdomains from passive DNS information seen in Farsightâ€™s DNSDB. DomainTools Iris Investigate and Farsight DNSDB API subscriptions are required to run this playbook.
 
Learn more about the Custom Connector via the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/domaintoolsirisinves or visit https://www.domaintools.com/integrations to request a Api key.

When a new Azure Sentinel Incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs below actions:

- It fetches all the Domain objects in the Incident.
- Iterates through the Domains objects and fetches the results from DomaintTools Iris Investigate and Farsight DNSDB for each Domain.
- All the details from DomainTools Iris Investigate and Farsight DNSDB will be added as comments in a tabular format.

### Post-Deployment instructions
#### a. Authorize connections 
Once deployment is complete, you will need to authorize each connection.
- Click the Azure Sentinel connection resource
- Click edit API connection
- Click Authorize
- Sign in
- Click Save
- Repeat steps for other connections such as DomainTools connector API Connection (For authorizing the DomainTools connector API connection, API Key and API secret needs to be provided.)
- Go to sentinel hook playbook to azure sentinel rules.
#### b. Configurations in Sentinel
- In Azure sentinel analytical rules should be configured to trigger an incident with risky user account. 
- Configure the automation rules to trigger the playbooks.
#### c. Managed Identity for Azure Sentinel Logic Apps connector
As a best practice, we used sentinel connection in playbooks that uses "ManagedSecurityIdentity". Please refer [this](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/what-s-new-managed-identity-for-azure-sentinel-logic-apps/ba-p/2068204)
