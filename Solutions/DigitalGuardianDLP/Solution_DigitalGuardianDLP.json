  "Description": "[Digital Guardian](https://digitalguardian.com/platform-overview) is unique among DLP solutions in its ability to support both a use case-based approach (known data types or user groups) or a data risk discovery approach (identifying unknown use cases). Our risk discovery approach enables to gain visibility by showing where sensitive data is located, how it flows in the organization, and where it is put at risk, all without policies.",
