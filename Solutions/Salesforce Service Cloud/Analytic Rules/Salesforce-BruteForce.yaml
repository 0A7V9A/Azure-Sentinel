name: Brute force attack against user credentials
description: |
  'Identifies evidence of brute force activity against a user based on multiple authentication failures 
  and at least one successful authentication within a given time window. Note that the query does not enforce any sequence,
  and does not require the successful authentication to occur last. This query limits IPAddresses to 100 and may not potentially cover all IPAddresses
  The default failure threshold is 10, success threshold is 1, and the default time window is 20 minutes.'
