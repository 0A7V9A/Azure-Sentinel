Go to Resource Group -> Access control (IAM) -> Role assignments\n\n 3. **Add client secret to the application**\n\n Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret) and create client secret in the application. Make sure to copy the Value of the client secret. You will need it on the next step."
