    "descriptionMarkdown": "SAP systems and applications handle massive volumes of business-critical data, hosted on cloud/on-premises infrastructure. Due to the complexity of the SAP ecosystem, security operations (SecOps) teams face the challenge of effectively monitoring and protecting their organization against growing threats. A breach of the SAP system could result in data loss, disruption to business processes, loss of revenue, and major reputation damage.\n The Microsoft Sentinel SAP connector, part of the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAPÂ® Applications, ingests SAP logs to Microsoft Sentinel workspaces. You can access raw data using the built-in Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP content or using custom content. The connector ingests SAP NetWeaver (RFC) application layer logs, including Security Auditlogs, Application logs, ChangeDocuments, Spool Logs, Change Request data, User masterdata, and more.\n The Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP will be generally available with a six-month free promotion starting in August 2022. Billing will start in February 2023, as an add-on charge in addition to the existing Microsoft Sentinel consumption-billing model for monitoring SAP production systems.",
