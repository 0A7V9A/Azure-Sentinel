    "Description": "SAP is synonymous with enterprise business. It drives multiple business applications and is the custodian for massive amounts of critical, sensitive data. SAP systems are growing in complexity as organizations expand beyond the base capabilities. This growth causes security risk to rise and allows threats to emerge across modules, so threat correlation is an important part of ensuring SAP security. The Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP BTP provides comprehensive and continuous threat detection and analytics, effectively identifying real threats and malicious behaviours. Microsoft Sentinel collects logs necessary for monitoring SAP BTP and includes out of the box security content (detections) for securing SAP BTP workloads.",
