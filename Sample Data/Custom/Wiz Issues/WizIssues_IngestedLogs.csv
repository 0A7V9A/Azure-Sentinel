    * Network Security Groups should not allow wide exposure (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0).
    * Restrict the exposure to specific ranges.
    * Ensure that sensitive ports (SSH, RDP, etc.) are not exposed.
    * Ensure the communication is encrypted and authentication if applicable.
    
4. Review the permissions granted by the Principal Raw Access Policy.
    * Remove administrator permissions e.g. iam:*
    * Avoid wild-card permissions, e.g. \*:*
    * Avoid wide permissions on a service level, e.g. s3:*
