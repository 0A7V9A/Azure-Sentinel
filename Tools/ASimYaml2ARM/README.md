# ASIM Yaml to ARM template converter

Use this tool to convert an ASIM parser YAML template to an ARM template that can easily be deployed.

Note that only the YAML 'ParserName' and 'ParserQuery' fields are important for the generated template. The 'Title' is also used as part of the template but is information only.
